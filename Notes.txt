1) Can we ignore the variable values that are meaningless to the classification?
2) Can we include rows that contain null values and ignore the variables with null values?
3) When we create a corresponding text value for each variable, how do we encode numbers? For example, the number 15,000 may appear in the
    text representation of multiple variables. How can we say that 15,000 belongs to each variable in a unique way?
